      <p><strong>CROSS-BORDER DATA TRANSFERS</strong></p>
      <p>
        When conducting business, working on Company projects, or implementing
        new processes or systems, an operation may require the transfer of
        personal information to other entities or third parties that are located
        outside of the The Assignment Hub operation’s country of business. While
        permissible data transfer mechanisms are defined by applicable law or
        regulation, examples include:
      </p>
      <ul class="text-white">
        <li>
          a data transfer agreement with the party who will access or obtain the
          personal information;
        </li>
        <li>
          notice to and/or approval from a country’s local data protection
          authority; or
        </li>
        <li>
          notice to and/or consent from the individual whose data is to be
          transferred.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>CONSENT AND CONTROL</strong></p>
      <p><strong>CONSENT</strong></p>
      <p>
        Consent is often referred to as an individual’s choice to “opt-in” or
        “opt-out” of the Company’s use of personal information and is usually
        obtained by a “checkbox” or signature confirming the individual
        understands and agrees to the processing of their personal information.
        At times, express written consent from the individual may be required
        based on the information processing activity. The Assignment Hub
        receives consent from individuals prior to: collecting, using, or
        processing their personal information, including sensitive personal
        information, in certain ways or sharing the individual’s personal
        information with any third party; transferring the individual’s personal
        information outside of the individual’s country of residence using or
        placing web cookies on an individual’s computer or other electronic
        devices.
      </p>

        modify any of your Personal Information that you have previously
        provided to us through www.theassignmenthub.com, or object to the use or
        processing of such Personal Information by us. If you have concerns

        that you have provided to us suppressed from our database or otherwise
        let us know what limitations you would like to put on our use of your
        Personal Information that you have provided to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the majority of questions and issues related to access can be
        handled quickly, complex requests may take more research and time. In
        such cases, issues will be addressed, or you will be contacted regarding
        the nature of the problem and appropriate next steps, within thirty
